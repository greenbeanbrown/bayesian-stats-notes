- Where P(B|A) is observed from the data sample
- The idea here is that we are able to solve P(A|B) as long as we know P(B|A) and P(A)

### Multiple Outcomes

### Continuous Bayes' Theorem
- The last part to the right represents a technique to simplify the equation (because the integral in the denominator can be very difficult to compute)
	- This involves 'ignoring' the normalizing constant
