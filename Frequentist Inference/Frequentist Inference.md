- Data is viewed as a sample of some larger, hypothetical population



### Confidence Intervals
- Expressing confidence in a given probability using bounds
	- i.e. Lower and Upper bound for a given probability

Bernoulli 95% Confidence Interval - 100 coin flips

### Inference Example - Fair or Fixed Coin Flip

Suppose your friend offers a coin flip bet to you, but you know he has a fair and a fixed coin. The fair coin obviously has a .50 EV of Heads, but the fixed coin has a 0.70 EV of Heads. He lets you flip the coin 5 times to determine whether you think it's fair or fixed and you get 2 Heads and 3 Tails (n=5, x=2). Determine whether or not the coin if fair or fixed given this experiment:

NOTE: the Frequentist approach gives us a framework for identifying the legitimacy of the coin, but does not give us a tool to assess the probability that our answer is correct.
