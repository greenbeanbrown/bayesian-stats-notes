- Basically saying, that with sufficiently large sample sizes, the sample average values approximately follow normal distributions
	- i.e. the average of a particular sample within a larger population follows a normal distribution


### Chocolate Chip Cookie Bag Example

- If you go to the store you can buy a bag of chocolate chips
	- There are many different bags from the same brand
	- Each bag has a different theoretical number of chips in the bag
- Let's say that each bag of chips contains chips following a Poisson distribution
	- i.e. each chip is an X ~ Poisson 
- If we take the average of each bag of chips, the distribution of those average values is Normal
	- We are taking an average of discrete values and thus end up with a distribution of continuous values
- The mean of the normal distribution is going to be the same as the mean of distribution for the individual cookies also
